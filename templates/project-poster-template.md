## ‚ùì Problem space

The goal of this section is to explain why solving this problem matters
by answering the prompts below. Ideally, the answers will be informed
by input from Lab leadership, the Hubverse, users, and/or funders.

### What are we doing?

What does the project propose to do?

### Why are we doing this?

What is high-level goal of this project?

### What are we _not_ trying to do?

Optional: What is out-of-scope for this project? This is a place where you can set up boundaries and anti-aims that will help prevent scope creep. 

### How do we judge success?

A list of outcomes that should be true for the project to be considered a
success. Be sure to focus on outcomes, not implementation details.

### What are possible solutions?

A high-level list of potential ways to meet the project's goals.

## ‚úÖ Validation

This section is for listing assumptions that should be validated before
kicking off a project. The answers to the prompts below may change over
time, as the team gets more information.

### What do we already know?

A list of information required before starting the project.
We already know the answers.

### What do we need to answer?

A list of information required before starting the project.
We need to find the answers.

## üëç Ready to make it

If, after defining the problem space and validating assumptions, the team
decides to move forward with the project, this section is to document
a proposed solution.

Keep the answers to the prompts below brief--this document isn't
inteded to be a detailed project plan.

### Proposed solution

1-2 sentences about the team's chosen approach for tackling the problem space.

### Visualize the solution

Optional. If there is a mockup, data dictionary, or other artifact that clarifies
the project's implementation, you can put it here (or link to it).

### Scale and scope

A place to define items like:

- Required team size
- Required delivery date (if applicable)
