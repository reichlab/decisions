# 2025-02-27 Collect a list of shared lab accounts

## Context

Reichlab has, over the years, created shared accounts on external sites, which for the most part have not been carefully tracked. Example sites include https://www.netlify.com/ , https://dnsimple.com/ , and https://www.namecheap.com/ , to name a few. The account created for each site is often a shared one where the username and password are passed between lab members needing access to that site. In some cases the site has an organization/team feature that the lab takes advantage of, but often this feature is paid, and sometimes we avoid a paid plan because we only need one account.

This situation puts the lab at risk because:

- sharing account details can be unsafe
- account details can be lost
- knowledge about accounts may be lost with personnel changes
- etc.

In anticipation of possibly adopting a centralized tool for managing these accounts, this decision is to collect a list of all shared accounts in one place. This list can then inform the decision about a tool.

### Aims

- Capture a list of all current shared Reichlab accounts in a single document.

### Anti-Aims

- Analyze current accounts and make decisions about them, whether they are still used, such as whether to switch to an organization/team plan, etc.

## Decision

We will create a "shared accounts" Google Sheet under the [Reich Lab > devteam Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PYeur8BbX5YL_ZRmnfXM61S6fTrJZmTk) with columns TBD that capture basic information about each site. There will be one row per account (multiple accounts for the same site will each be on separate rows).

## Status

Proposed

## Consequences

Having this list of shared lab accounts will enable analysis and a decision about whether/how to better manage them, e.g., use a lab-wide tool to manage accounts, sign up for organization/team plans, etc.

## Projects

- None
